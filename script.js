//will need to use 'concat' somewhere once they have chosen character types. I think you create a new var,
// and then combine the strings in it.
    // ex: var combo = lowercase.concat(uppercase,numbers); Will look something like this.

//Will need to find a randomizing function. 'Math.random' 'math.floor' or something like that?
    //generate a random password. Something like this. 
      // Get random index from array of options (this is from R,P,Scissors game)
