# H3-JS-passwordGenerator
This is my 3rd homework assignment for the University of Washington Full Stack Developer Coding Bootcamp. The assignment was to use Javascript to create a 
random password generator.

## We were given the following User Story: 
    As an employee with access to sensitive data, I want to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria, so that I can create a strong password that
    provides greater security.
## Acceptance Criteria:
  1. When you click the button to generate the password, the user is provided with a series of prompts for password criteria.
  2. When prompted, the user is then able to make a selection of which character types to include (lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and special characters).
  3. When prompted for password length, the user must choose at least 8 characters, with a maximum of 128 characters.
  4. When all prompts are answered, then user input is validated and at least one character type should be used.
  5. If the user does not choose at least one character type, an alert must pop up on the screen.
  6. If the user chooses a number less than the minimum, or more than the maximum, an alert must pop up on the screen.
  7. Once all prompts are answered and selections validation, a random password is generated.
  8. Assignment should not produce any errors to the console.
  ## Programming Languages Used:
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - Javascript
  ## Motivation
      Aside from being a required assignment, I was really looking forward to using my newly developed Javavscript skills. When I was first introduced to Javascript, 
      I found the language to be really intuitive, and immediately felt comfortable with the logic and conditional statements. This assignment was the
    first time I used Javascript to actually create something, rather than just solving singular problems in excercises, tutorials, etc. I found that it was no 
    longer quite as intuitive as I had originally thought. 
      
      One reason that I found it to be particularly challenging, was that I was not immediately able to see the results of my work. With HTML and CSS, you can 
    immediately see your code applied, and your webpage's growing structure and style. With this particular Javascript assignment, I was waiting for an end result.
    To make it easier on myself, I applied console.logs to each piece of my code, so that I could check to make sure things were working, as I was building the code.
    I was able to remove some of them as I went along.
    
    Overall, I found this project to be very challenging, and am proud of what I accomplished. I can't wait to see what I can do with Javascript next!

  ## Contributors
  
  While I did not work with anybody on this assignment, I do want to mention that the HTML and CSS pages were provided to us by the University of Washington Coding Bootcamp, and I am not responsible for creating any of the styling, sizing, or color choices of the webpage. The Javascript however, was all me! Thanks for reading!
